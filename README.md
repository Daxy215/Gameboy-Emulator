A Gameboy emulator in C++.

Doing this just to learn more about emulators and I'm not focused on optimization,
I'm also not really focused on ensuring this emulator is accurate.

The Emulator can run most games without much issues,
however, I haven't had the chance to improve the UI,
elements to load in a ROM at runtime.

It has almost all of the APU channels implemented.

The emulator does contain a basic(not fully implemented yet) disassembler.

### TODO - Normal version:
- [ ] Implement channel 4 of the APU
- [ ] Improve accerucy for the APU

- [ ] RTC Clock for MBC3
- [ ] Improve accerucy for the Timer

### TODO - Color version:
- [ ] Sprite order is messed up
